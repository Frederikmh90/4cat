4chan data is scraped internally by 4CAT. Some earlier data may be derived from the archive [4plebs](https://archive.4plebs.org).

Results are limited to 5 million items maximum. Be sure to read the query syntax for local data sources first - your query design will significantly impact the results. Note that large queries can take a long time to complete!
